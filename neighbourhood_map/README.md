# Neighbourhood Map
## The Final Project of the Front-End Developer Nanodegree course offered by Udacity

This project consists of using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a variety of techniques and frameworks and APIs to create a responsive neighbourhood map, with locations of interest and descriptions.

The venues shown here are some of my favourite places, so the list may be a bit biased.

You can filter results by typing into the search bar, and clicking a list entry will show it on the map.

In **mobile mode**, the sidebar is collapsible, and may be called by clicking on the top leftmost button, the **menu** button. After clicking on an entry, the menu will automatically collapse to ease navigation.
<br> At all times there is a button on the top rightmost corner. This button toggles the **traffic** overlay on the map!

### To run this project:

Clone or download it, and run index.html.
