===============================

This is a project for Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree course.

To run the game, download the zip and run the index.html file!

To win, you have to dodge the incoming bugs and reach the water. This game was made to be played on a keyboard, using the standard arrow keys for movement!

If you hit any bugs, the player has to start over.

If you reach the water, the player's position is reset.
