#### [Portfolio](https://lucasbadur.github.io/Portfolio/)
A portfolio mockup, using HTML, CSS, and responsive design.
<br>This project aimed to test the student's understanding of HTML and CSS, along with media queries and how to test for a responsive design.

#### [Pixel Art Maker](https://lucasbadur.github.io/Pixel-Art-Maker/)
An interactive pixel painter, with a grid size selector and a color selector.
<br>The goal was to play around with Javascript, getting used to listeners, selectors, and functions.
<br>This project is an interactive webpage, offering users a dynamic grid creator, and a color selector to paint squares within said grid.
