#### [Portfolio](https://lucasbadur.github.io/Portfolio/)
A portfolio mockup, using HTML, CSS, and responsive design.
<br>This project aimed to test the student's understanding of HTML and CSS, along with media queries and how to test for a responsive design.

#### [Pixel Art Maker](https://lucasbadur.github.io/Pixel-Art-Maker/)
An interactive pixel painter, with a grid size selector and a color selector.
<br>The goal was to play around with Javascript, getting used to listeners, selectors, and functions.
<br>This project is an interactive webpage, offering users a dynamic grid creator, and a color selector to paint squares within said grid.

#### [Memory Game](https://lucasbadur.github.io/Memory-Game/)
A traditional memory card game.
<br>There's a 4 by 4 grid with cards placed down, the goal of the game is to find each pair of matching cards.

#### [Arcade Game Clone](https://lucasbadur.github.io/Arcade-Game-Clone/)
A clone of Frogger, implemented with JavaScript and jQuery.

#### [Feedreader Testing](https://lucasbadur.github.io/Feedreader-Testing/)
A project intended to familiarize students with test suites.

#### [Neighbourhood Map](https://lucasbadur.github.io/Neighbourhood-Map/)
The final project of the course, a map of a region containing interest points. Created using jQuery, Knockout, Materialize, Google Maps API, Foursquare API.
<br>Students were required to use Knockout to handle the list of points, and a map API to draw the region and its corresponding markers. (I've used Google Maps)
<br>Using the Foursquare API, it's possible to obtain information for each marker / place, and display it in an infobox.
