## Front-End Developer Nanodegree

This is a repository for my personal projects developed during the Front-End Developer Nanodegree course offered by Udacity.

#### [Portfolio](https://lucasbadur.github.io/Portfolio/)
A portfolio mockup, using HTML, CSS, and responsive design.

#### [Pixel Art Maker](https://lucasbadur.github.io/Pixel-Art-Maker/)
An interactive pixel painter, with a grid size selector and a color selector.
This project is an interactive webpage, offering users a dynamic grid creator, and a color selector to paint squares within said grid.
